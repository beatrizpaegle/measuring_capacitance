# measuring_capacitance
 This project was developed by me and Arthur Pimentel in the discipline of python for engineering. The course was offered by professor Hermano Cabral at DES-UFPE.

This design measures the capacitance of a capacitor and compares differents way to calculate it, and plot a graph to help to choose the best way to measure it.
Isn't a only software project, it's a electronic lab project that needs a oscilloscope and a specified circuit connected. 

This project was done using the pyoscilloscope library that know changed and is like this link: https://github.com/davidrft/OscilloscoPy
